<h3 id="orga7567c2"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been learning AWS recently while working towards getting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</a> certification. Setting up a good personal website has been on my to-do list for a while so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to get some practical experience on the platform.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the pricing as I had first considered running an EC2 instance, but I then saw that Lightsail instances were a lot cheaper. They&rsquo;re essentially just like a VPS on any other cloud platform. I spun up an instance and selected the WordPress template maintained by Bitnami.
</p>

<p>
I had a website up and running really quickly, but on reflection, WordPress seemed a little bloated. I use Emacs as my editor of choice, so using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> with the <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> package seemed a perfect fit.
</p>

<p>
I tried following a tutorial that involved pushing the code to CodeCommit, CodePipeline would pick up the change and then kick off a build with CodeBuild to run Hugo and sync the public folder to an S3 bucket. It was a cool <a href="https://conormclaughlin.net/2017/11/automating-deployment-of-your-hugo-site-to-s3-using-aws-codepipeline/">tutorial</a> and quite a novel solution, but it failed a few times for me when running Hugo in the build job. I was looking through the Hugo documentation to see where I was going wrong when I noticed the &ldquo;hugo deploy&rdquo; command. This command just uploads the public directory to an S3 bucket for you!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4ce8313" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4ce8313"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Setting up the S3 Bucket</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Log into AWS and go into the S3 section then click &ldquo;Create bucket&rdquo;
</p>


<div id="org847966a" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/createbucket.png" alt="createbucket.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Name the bucket after your website (it doesn&rsquo;t need to be the site name, it can say anything) and select an AWS region, I&rsquo;m going for eu-west-2 because it&rsquo;s close to me.
</p>


<div id="org20388dd" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/namebucket.png" alt="namebucket.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Untick the &ldquo;Block all public access&rdquo; box and acknowledge the warning at the bottom of that section. See the image above for all the settings I&rsquo;ve used. Once you&rsquo;re happy, scroll to the bottom and select &ldquo;Create bucket&rdquo;
</p>


<div id="org34c1be9" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/selectbucket.png" alt="selectbucket.png" />  
</p>
</div>

<p>
Once created, click into the bucket and then click into the properties tab.
</p>


<div id="org2752421" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/selectproperties.png" alt="selectproperties.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Scroll down to the bottom and select Edit on Static website hosting
</p>


<div id="org44e2a60" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/selectstatichosting.png" alt="selectstatichosting.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Enable static website hosting and enter the page file names index.html and error.html respectively. when you&rsquo;re done save the changes.
</p>


<div id="orged0b5bc" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/editstatichosting.png" alt="editstatichosting.png" />

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3540bd7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3540bd7"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Set up a user in IAM</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Open the IAM dashboard and select users from the left-hand side. Select Add Users and add a user called &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; with access key as the credential type.
</p>


<div id="orgc6b2ecf" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/addhugouser.png" alt="addhugouser.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Go to the next page and select Create Group. Create a group called &ldquo;hugo&rdquo;, search for s3 in the policies and check the box for AmazonS3FullAccess, then select Create Group. Next click into Tags, add any tags you like, click into Review and when you&rsquo;re happy, create the user.
</p>


<div id="org3163964" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/addhugogroup.png" alt="addhugogroup.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the final page, you&rsquo;ll be given the Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key
</p>


<div id="orgdd48778" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/hugoaccesskeys2.png" alt="hugoaccesskeys2.png" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
Take a note of these for later and don&rsquo;t share them with anyone:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Access Key ID:
AKIA4QJB6VGADXAFZ3RZ

Secret Access Key:
rEtNcvATlIyMsz+wZdiDCM//FSPZ2E0WMJl6dhlT
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-orga046614" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga046614"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Installing the AWS CLI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Curl the installer file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"\
unzip awscliv2.zip\
</pre>

<p>
Run the installer:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo ./aws/install
</pre>
<p>
Then configure the CLI with your credentials from earlier
</p>


<div id="org6b9384c" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/hugos3/awsconfigure2.png" alt="awsconfigure2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You should now be able to interact with your AWS subscription. Try running &ldquo;aws s3 ls&rdquo; and you should see the bucket you&rsquo;ve created.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[username@hostname]$ aws s3 ls
2022-08-19 21:36:22 dougiepeart.co.uk
</pre>

<p>
You&rsquo;ve now got the AWS CLI set up, now all that&rsquo;s left is to configure Hugo to push to your bucket (and configure your Hugo site, but that&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this tutorial).
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org62e80f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org62e80f3"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Configuring Hugo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Inside your config.toml file for your Hugo site append the following:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[deployment]
  [[deployment.targets]]
    name = "aws-s3"
    URL= "s3://dougiepeart.co.uk?region=eu-west-2"

<p>
Ordinarily, you&rsquo;d set an A record here pointing to an IP address, but as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed, AWS didn&rsquo;t allocate us one. Not to worry though, you don&rsquo;t need an A record, you can just use a CNAME.

<h4 id="org5b6fe9e"><span class="section-number-4">2.7.1.</span> Myths and Misconceptions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-7-1">
<p>
The Stoics often dealt with Stoicism being misunderstood as being a cold philosophy. They were mistaken to be cold and unfeeling. However, Stoics taught that no one should strive to be an unfeeling statue.
</p>

<p>
Living a virtuous life leads to living a life rich with emotion. Embracing the positive, whilst quickly overcoming the negative.
</p>

<p>
Passivity is another common mischaracterisation. Stoics believe you can thrive in any situation, it teaches acceptance of the world as it is. A love of one&rsquo;s fate. Amor Fati. This can be confused with Apathy. &ldquo;Why change,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;if one can be happy even in the worst of life&rsquo;s storms?&rdquo;. It may seem paradoxical, but Stoic acceptance gives one the strength to overcome life&rsquo;s challenges. When a rude person makes aggressive demands, the Stoic accepts that the person in front of them is being hostile, but they can choose how to respond. If the rude person&rsquo;s demands are unjust, the Stoic works for justice.
</p>

<p>
When you direct your attention toward that which you can control, your actions become well-aimed and effective.

&ldquo;When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act it is.

And so you will do in every act: for thus if any hindrance to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready: it was not this only that I intended, but I intended also to maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.&rdquo;

<li><a id="org9852d5d"></a>Wisdom<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-7-4-1">
<p>
Wisdom is most closely associated with the Discipline of Assent. It can be subdivided into the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good Sense</li>
<li>Good Calculation</li>
<li>Quick-wittedness</li>
<li>Discretion</li>
<li>Resourcefulness</li>
</ul>

<p>
The primary role of Wisdom is to lead you to good; to focus your attention on healthy thoughts, opinions, desires, and aversions. It requires constant attention. Practising wisdom requires you to understand that you aren&rsquo;t required to accept the first reaction that comes to mind. You must instead build a bridge between your reaction and your final action.

<li><a id="org41404fe"></a>Courage<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-7-4-2">
<p>
Courage is mastery over your fears. It stands in opposition to cowardice. Courage is one of the two virtues that are linked to the Discipline of Desire. If you no longer focus your desires and aversions towards the external world but instead strive for virtue, you will unleash the power to act against the intolerable. The Stoics break Courage down into the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Endurance</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>High-mindedness</li>
<li>Cheerfulness</li>
<li>Industriousness</li>

<li><a id="org44a35b2"></a>Justice<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-7-4-3">
<p>
Justice relates to the Discipline of Action. Justice is not a direct translation of our definition of Justice (to abide by the law). It can be more easily understood as <i>morality</i>. It encompasses all of our interactions with others. Stoicism teaches that all people are valuable and that we are meant to work together. Stoic Justice helps you to work with others, even if they are opposed to it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;He who is running a race ought to endeavour and strive to the utmost of his ability to come off victor; but it is utterly wrong for him to trip up his competitor, or to push him aside. So in life it is not unfair for one to seek for himself what may accrue to his benefit; but it is not right to take it from another.&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
&#x2013;Chrysippus
As quoted in De Officiis by Cicero, iii. 10.

<p>
As Marcus Aurelius puts it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2:1
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Justice can be broken down into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Goodwill</li>
<li>Benevolence</li>
<li>Kindness</li>
</ul>

<li><a id="orga57685d"></a>Temperance (Moderation)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-7-4-4">
<p>
Temperance is control over one&rsquo;s desires and, along with Courage, it is an expected outcome of practising the Discipline of Desire. Moderation stands in opposition to excess. If you desire only virtue, then you can be reasonable in what you want and generous with what you have been given. Moderation can be divided into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Appropriateness</li>
<li>Modesty</li>
<li>Self-control</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The Stoics viewed life as a banquet. Picture yourself at a party where the host went all out with the food and drink. Imagine expensive wines, mouthwatering dishes, and decadent desserts. Everyone’s grabbing plates and glasses and heading over to get their fill. How are you going to act? Are you going to pile your plate high so you don’t miss out on anything? Will you fill up your glass knowing there’s not enough of that particular wine for everyone to try? If you miss out on the dessert you had your eye on, will it ruin your night? If you get to it in time, will you take so much that others don’t get to enjoy it? Epictetus says that a Stoic won’t desire that dessert before they have it and therefore won’t be disturbed if they never get it. If the dessert does arrive, they won’t take so much that others will be left without. Also, if they really grasp Stoicism, they might choose to let the dessert pass even though it arrives. That Stoic, Epictetus claims, is worthy of ruling with the gods! The banquet metaphor is meant to apply to all of your interactions. If you direct your desire toward being your best self, you won’t focus on getting things, but on using the things you already have.&rdquo;

To do this, you only allow yourself to dwell on the present, essentially fencing yourself off from the future and the past. Take a breath. Draw your attention to the present moment. The past is finished. The future is unknowable. Leave anxieties about the future alone; they solely exist in your imagination. You can only act in the present.&ldquo;

He told them to leave behind thoughts of “it’s painted so beautifully” and “it was a birthday present,” so they could see it as just a cup. A cup that, if broken, isn’t worth losing your good flow of life. When anything presents itself to you, particularly if it seems in some way overwhelming, stop and define it at its most basic. Do not add value judgments. Clear away its mystique so that you can move forward with a clear head.

<p>
Marcus Aurelius would use this practice to avoid temptation. For instance, he would use it when he felt himself in danger of making a decision based on lust.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-7-8-9">
<p>
When anything begins to take over your mind. Think of the phrase &ldquo;This is nothing to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If you are hoping for something to happen, like getting a promotion at work and the anticipation or the outcome turns into negative thoughts. Re-frame it in your mind by saying &ldquo;This promotion is nothing to me&rdquo; It will not affect your ability to live with virtue. It will not stop you from being the best possible version of yourself.
</p>

<p>
This stops the situation from stealing away the positive emotions you could be experiencing right now.

&ldquo;The only possession the wise person has is virtue, and of this they can never be robbed. Of all else they have merely the use on loan.&rdquo;

&#x2013; Seneca, On the Firmness of the Wise Man
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Stoics taught that all indifferents should be viewed as being on loan. All things will come to an end, no person is immortal, and nothing lasts forever.
</p>

<p>
If you treat everything as if it will be yours forever and you lose it. Then you are building yourself up to feel negative thoughts. Saying &ldquo;It was returned&rdquo; when you lose something will remind you that nothing lasts forever and you will learn to appreciate the present, the time you have with it or the time you had with it after it is gone.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgecbfd56"></a>Fear<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-7-12-1-1">
<p>
Fear is the expectation of a coming evil. Some of the feelings that flow from fear are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Terror</li>
<li>Hesitation</li>
<li>Shame</li>
<li>Shock</li>
<li>Panic</li>
<li>Anguish (Regret)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shame is the fear of being disgraced, but can you be disgraced if you act with virtue? No, no one can disgrace you and no one can cause you to act without virtue.
</p>

<p>
All fears are built on indifferents. The Dichotomy of Control will help you to see that indifferents are out of your control.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgc6d9721"></a>Lust (Appetite)<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-7-12-1-2">
<p>
Lust is the desire for an expected good. It is focused on the future. The future is out of your control so why concern yourself with it?
</p>

<p>
Some of the feelings associated with Lust include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Want</li>
<li>Hatred</li>
<li>Contention</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Lust</li>
<li>Wrath</li>
<li>Rage</li>
</ul>

<p>
Desire only what you have and you will overcome Lust. Imagine living without dissatisfaction? If you can learn to only desire your own virtuous actions in life, then you won&rsquo;t have an overwhelming appetite for indifferent things.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgc40f14a"></a>Delight (Pleasure)<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-7-12-1-3">
<p>
Delight is a mistaken elation over something that seems to be good in the here and now. It includes such things as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rejoicing at others misfortune</li>
<li>Self-gratification</li>
<li>Extravagant joy</li>
</ul>

<p>
This isn&rsquo;t to say that happiness is a bad thing, far from it. Delight ties your well-being to things you own or a particular moment, all of which can be taken from you. The opposite of Delight is Joy, the state of mind that finds positivity despite the impermanence of things or moments.

</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org866119e"></a>Distress<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-2-7-12-1-4">
<p>
Distress is the irrational drawing away of the mind from something already present. The following emotions come from Distress:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Malice</li>
<li>Envy</li>
<li>Jealousy</li>
<li>Pity</li>
<li>Grief</li>
<li>Worry</li>
<li>Sorrow</li>
<li>Annoyance</li>
<li>Vexation</li>
<li>Anguish</li>
</ul>

<p>
To overcome Distress, you must make room for other good passions to flourish. One technique for this is the festival mindset:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re alone you should call this tranquillity and freedom, and think of yourself like the gods; and when you are with many, you shouldn&rsquo;t call it a crowd, or trouble, or uneasiness, but festival and company, and contentedly accept it&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Epictetus, Discourses 1:12
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When you are at a festival or a concert, you have a great time and the crowds don&rsquo;t annoy you at all. You welcome the crowds, they are all there with you, and you are all sharing the same experience. These are your people. Why not try applying this to any situation?

<p>
&ldquo;Do not disturb yourself by picturing your life as a whole; do not assemble in your mind the many and varied troubles which have come to you in the past and will come again in the future, but ask yourself with regard to every present difficulty: ‘What is there in this that is unbearable and beyond endurance?’ You would be ashamed to confess it! And then remind yourself that it is not the future or what has passed that afflicts you, but always the present, and the power of this is much diminished if you take it in isolation and call your mind to task if it thinks that it cannot stand up to it when taken on its own.&rdquo;
</p>

&#x2013; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8:36

<p>
This points back to Socrates&rsquo;s view that no one desires to do evil. They do not know any better, for if they did, they would act better. You cannot expect people to act with the knowledge you have, because they do not have access to that. This reminds me of a quote that is often falsely attributed to Marcus Aurelius:
</p>

<p>
“Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”

<p>
Choose some of the practices that are talked about in this book to incorporate into your daily life. Creating a Stoic routine is grounding. It will give you the strength to weather any of life&rsquo;s storms.
</p>

<p>
Start the day with a morning orientation, journal, and think about the events and tasks today brings and how best to prepare for them.
</p>

<p>
End your day with an evening reflection, such as the Pythagorean practice from page 32:
&ldquo;What have I done wrong? What have I done well? What have I left that must be done tomorrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Find the method that works for you. Matthew talks about when he first started he would write a few phrases on scraps of paper and keep them in his pocket. If he felt stressed, he would read a relevant phrase that would help him to centre himself.
</p>

<p>
If you prepare and deal with bad times properly, they&rsquo;ll be good times. That is to say that if you live according to the virtues in every situation and virtues are the only good, then any situation can be a source of contentment for being the best possible version of yourself. This doesn&rsquo;t mean being joyful if someone has died, but rather acting according to what the situation demands of you and being rewarded for that with deep inner satisfaction.

<p>
This is a common view of developers from an IT operations perspective. However, it&rsquo;s quite unfair. I believe the only reason this seems to be the case is because there isn&rsquo;t enough communication between Development and Operations in traditional organisations. With good and frequent communication there would be an ongoing conversation for what changes need to be made and what the impact these changes could have. It&rsquo;s only by not talking that these situations happen and both sides are guilty of it.

To improve the flow of work you need to identify your constraints. In the book Brent was the main one. He was involved in pretty every piece of operational work at some level. If he was busy with other work some projects would remain at a standstill.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Erik says, smiling. Gesturing broadly
at the plant floor below, he says, “Imagine if twenty-five percent of all the
work centers down there could only be operated by one person named
Brent. What would happen to the flow of work?”
I close my eyes to think.
“Work wouldn’t complete on time, because Brent can only be at one
work center at a time,” I say. Enthusiastically, I continue, “That’s ex-
actly what’s happening with us. I know that for a bunch of our planned
changes, work can’t even start if Brent isn’t on hand. When that happens,
we’ll escalate to Brent, telling him to drop whatever he’s doing, so some
other work center can get going. We’ll be lucky if he can stay there long
enough for the change to be completely implemented before he’s inter-
rupted by someone else.”

<p>
To confirm that this limited vision was not some quirk of Jobs’s keynote script, I spoke with Andy Grignon, who was one of the original iPhone team members. “This was supposed to be an iPod that made phone calls,” he confirmed. “Our core mission was playing music and making phone calls.” As Grignon then explained to me, Steve Jobs was initially dismissive of the idea that the iPhone would become more of a general-purpose mobile computer running a variety of different third-party applications. “The second we allow some knucklehead programmer to write some code that crashes it,” Jobs once told Grignon, “that will be when they want to call 911.”

<p>
The iPhone was never supposed to be anything more than a phone and a media player to reduce the number of devices you had to carry around.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It’s widely accepted that new technologies such as social media and smartphones massively changed how we live in the twenty-first century. There are many ways to portray this change. I think the social critic Laurence Scott does so quite effectively when he describes the modern hyper-connected existence as one in which “a moment can feel strangely flat if it exists solely in itself.”

<p>
It&rsquo;s sad, isn&rsquo;t it? You experience something and feel compelled to capture it rather than live in the moment.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-2-2-1">
<blockquote>
<p>
Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.

<li><a id="org127feb6"></a>Principle #2: Optimization is important.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-2-2-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-2-2-3">
<blockquote>
<p>
Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.

<blockquote>
<p>
▪ As he notes in Walden, working a large farm, as many of his Concord neighbors did, required large, stressful mortgages, the need to maintain numerous pieces of equipment, and endless, demanding labor. He describes these farmer neighbors as “crushed and smothered under [their] load” and famously lumps them into the “mass of men lead[ing] lives of quiet desperation.”
Thoreau then asks what benefits these worn-down farmers receive from the extra profit they eke out. As he proved in his Walden experiment, this extra work is not enabling the farmers to escape savage conditions: Thoreau was able to satisfy all of his basic needs quite comfortably with the equivalent of one day of work per week. What these farmers are actually gaining from all the life they sacrifice is slightly nicer stuff: venetian blinds, a better quality copper pot, perhaps a fancy wagon for traveling back and forth to town more efficiently.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-6-2-3">
<p>
The Digital Declutter is a process that Newport suggests you take at the start of your digital minimalism journey. It involves taking a 30-day break from all optional technologies. Optional technologies are those in which if you stopped using them they would not harm or significantly disrupt your professional or personal life (i.e email)

<p>
To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter, it must:

<p>
1, Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough).
</p>

<p>
2, Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better).
</p>

<p>
3, Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-6-3">
<p>
Newport sets out some practices to best achieve Digital Minimalism following your Digital Declutter
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org3a66155"></a>4: Spend Time Alone<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-6-3-1">
<p>
This doesn&rsquo;t mean becoming a hermit in which you hike miles into the woods and live in a cabin, but instead advocates for spending quality time in solitude so one can free their mind from the outside inputs of other minds to better process your thoughts, feelings and impressions.
</p>

<p>
Newport suggests that people who are addicted to social media suffer from &ldquo;Solitude Deprivation&rdquo;:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To simplify our discussion, let’s give this trend its own name:
Solitude Deprivation
A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org44c837e"></a>5: Don&rsquo;t click &ldquo;Like&rdquo;<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-6-3-2">
<p>
Newport contends that remaining in constant social contact with friends and family does not provide quality social interaction. Studies have shown that those that spend more time on social media feel more lonely. Instead, you should ideally focus on having face-to-face interactions with those you care about and unchain yourself from your devices.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org8bf1ced"></a>PRACTICE: CONSOLIDATE TEXTING<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-2-1">
<p>
Newport suggests limiting your texting time to certain portions of the day and treating them more like emails. This allows you to be in control of how text messages fit into your day. Leaving them to when you choose to interact, rather than interrupting you at the whims of others.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
▪ When you’re in this mode, text messages become like emails: if you want to see if anyone has sent you something, you must turn on your phone and open the app. You can now schedule specific times for texting—consolidated sessions in which you go through the backlog of texts you received since the last check, sending responses as needed and perhaps even having some brief back-and-forth interaction before apologizing that you have to go, turning the phone back to Do Not Disturb mode, and continuing with your day.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgeafc772"></a>PRACTICE: HOLD CONVERSATION OFFICE HOURS<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-2-2">
<p>
Having conversation office hours seems to be a great idea to implement into your life. It allows people to avoid the anxiety of phoning you in case you are busy.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
▪ I learned it from a technology executive in Silicon Valley who innovated a novel strategy for supporting high-quality interaction with friends and family: he tells them that he’s always available to talk on the phone at 5:30 p.m. on weekdays. There’s no need to schedule a conversation or let him know when you plan to call—just dial him up. As it turns out, 5:30 is when he begins his traffic-clogged commute home in the Bay Area. He decided at some point that he wanted to put this daily period of car confinement to good use, so he invented the 5:30 rule.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If someone texts you trying to initiate a low-value conversation over messaging you can instead reply to their text inviting them to call at an allotted time:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
▪ I’d love to get up to speed on what’s going on in your life, call me at 5:30 sometime.”

<li><a id="orgff2408b"></a>6: Reclaim Leisure<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-6-3-3">
<p>
To truly succeed with Digital Minimalism one replaces their &ldquo;low-quality leisure&rdquo; (Social Media) with &ldquo;high-quality leisure&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="orgfb62cbb"></a>The Bennett Principle<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-3-1">
<blockquote>
<p>
A decade later, Arnold Bennett took up the cause of active leisure in his short but influential self-help guide, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day. In this book, Bennett notes that the average London middle-class white-collar worker putting in an eight-hour day is left with sixteen additional hours during which he is as free as any gentleman to pursue virtuous activity. Bennett argues that the waking half of these hours could be dedicated to enriching and demanding leisure, but were instead too often wasted by frivolous time-killing pastimes, like smoking, pottering, caressing the piano (but not actually playing), and perhaps deciding to become “acquainted with a genuinely good whiskey.” After an evening of this mindless boredom busting (the Victorian equivalent of idling on your iPad), he notes, you fall exhausted into bed, with all the hours you were granted “gone like magic, unaccountably gone.”
</p>

<p>
Bennett argues that these hours should instead be put to use for demanding and virtuous leisure activities. Bennett, being an early twentieth-century British snob, suggests activities that center on reading difficult literature and rigorous self-reflection. In a representative passage, Bennett dismisses novels because they “never demand any appreciable mental application.” A good leisure pursuit, in Bennett’s calculus, should require more “mental strain” to enjoy (he recommends difficult poetry). He also ignores the possibility that some of this leisure time might be reduced by childcare or housework, as he was writing only for men, who in Bennett’s early twentieth-century middle-class British world, of course, never needed to bother with such things.

<p>
Try to use your leisure time to produce something that you are proud of, this could be a physical object through the craft of woodwork, or a piece of music.

<li><a id="orgbd66f85"></a>Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-3-4">
<p>
Newport&rsquo;s suggestion here is that you try social activities like board games with friends.

<li><a id="org7564cd8"></a>PRACTICE: FIX OR BUILD SOMETHING EVERY WEEK<br /></li>

<li><a id="orgc616410"></a>PRACTICE: SCHEDULE YOUR LOW-QUALITY LEISURE<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-3-6">
<p>
Being a digital minimalist does not mean swearing off social media altogether. You can still do it, but Newport advises that you instead schedule it and limit the amount of time you are exposed to it. Social media can be a very useful tool for knowing what is going on in people&rsquo;s lives, but it must remain that, a tool.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org48ca36e"></a>PRACTICE: JOIN SOMETHING<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-3-7">
<blockquote>
<p>
▪ In 1727, Franklin created a social club called the Junto, which he describes as follows in his autobiography:
I had form’d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps we should all take a leaf out of Franklin&rsquo;s book, if we don&rsquo;t have a group of like-minded individuals we can join, why not try creating the group ourselves?
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgbfd7a01"></a>PRACTICE: FOLLOW LEISURE PLANS<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-3-8">
<p>
If your leisure time is filled with low-quality activities you should consider creating and following leisure plans to aid you in creating value in your life.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org48aa731"></a>The Seasonal Leisure Plan<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-6-3-3-8-1">
<p>
Every quarter put together a plan that consists of objectives and habits that you intend to honour in the upcoming period.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org41db693"></a>Objective<br />
<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-4-6-3-3-8-1-1">
<p>
Set an objective you would like to achieve and then outline the strategies you will follow to help achieve this objective.
</p>

<p>
Here is the example that Newport uses:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>


<p>
Objective: Learn on the guitar every song from the A-side of Meet the Beatles!
</p>

<p>
Strategies:
</p>

<p>
Restring and retune my guitar, find the chord charts for the songs, print them, and put them in nice plastic protector sheets.
</p>

<p>
Return to my old habit of regularly practicing my guitar.
</p>

<p>
As incentive, schedule Beatles party in November. Perform songs (get Linda to agree to sing).
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>


<li><a id="org0e7af9f"></a>Habit<br />
<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-4-6-3-3-8-1-2">
<p>
Pick a habit you&rsquo;d like to keep over the period. These do not have to be related to the objective.
</p>

<p>
Here are the examples that Newport gives:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Habit: During the week, restrict low-quality leisure to only sixty minutes a night.
</p>

<p>
Habit: Read something in bed every night.
</p>

<p>
Habit: Attend one cultural event per week.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org85d129b"></a>PRACTICE: DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM YOUR PHONE<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-4-1">
<p>
If you need to access social media, use your computer instead of your phone.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org6422b18"></a>PRACTICE: TURN YOUR DEVICES INTO SINGLE-PURPOSE COMPUTERS<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-4-2">
<p>
When using your device try to limit distractions by utilising distraction-blocking software and/or turning off the wifi to allow yourself to focus on your task.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org40c522b"></a>PRACTICE: USE SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE A PROFESSIONAL<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-4-3">
<p>
Follow only what you need on social media to extract only information that adds value.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgde489b0"></a>PRACTICE: EMBRACE SLOW MEDIA<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-4-4">
<p>
Rather than following a story as soon as it breaks, instead, wait a day or two to catch up on the story when informed conclusions have been made from those that you trust. In short limit your news sources to a few trusted ones, rather than hundreds of untrusted ones.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgb831186"></a>PRACTICE: DUMB DOWN YOUR SMARTPHONE<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-6-3-4-5">
<p>
Consider using swapping to a dumbed down phone such as products like the <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/">Lightphone</a> to untether yourself from distractions.

<h4 id="org11a6f8e"><span class="section-number-4">4.6.4.</span> In Summary</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-6-4">
<p>
We all need to think about our use of technology and question whether we are using it as a tool, or whether it has taken over our lives and attention. I know for at least myself in the past I had a very unhealthy relationship with social media and withdrew from it.
</p>

<p>
First, it was Facebook, and I didn&rsquo;t miss a single thing about the service once I left it. The next was Instagram and I had the same experience, it didn&rsquo;t add any value to my life apart from knowing what those I care about are up to. But is looking at a friend&rsquo;s picture a real interaction with value? I think instead you&rsquo;re better placed to get in touch with them in person or over the phone. Our lives are flooded with low-value interactions these days that mean little.
