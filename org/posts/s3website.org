* Introduction
I've been learning AWS recently while working towards getting the [[https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/][AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate]] certification. Setting up a good personal website has been on my to-do list for a while so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to get some practical experience on the platform.

I looked at the pricing as I had first considered running an EC2 instance, but I then saw that Lightsail instances were a lot cheaper. They're essentially just like a VPS on any other cloud platform. I spun up an instance and selected the WordPress template maintained by Bitnami.

I had a website up and running really quickly, but on reflection, WordPress seemed a little bloated. I use Emacs as my editor of choice, so using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] with the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] package seemed a perfect fit.

I tried following a tutorial that involved pushing the code to CodeCommit, CodePipeline would pick up the change and then kick off a build with CodeBuild to run Hugo and sync the public folder to an S3 bucket. It was a cool [[https://conormclaughlin.net/2017/11/automating-deployment-of-your-hugo-site-to-s3-using-aws-codepipeline/][tutorial]] and quite a novel solution, but it failed a few times for me when running Hugo in the build job. I was looking through the Hugo documentation to see where I was going wrong when I noticed the "hugo deploy" command. This command just uploads the public directory to an S3 bucket for you!

* Setting up the S3 Bucket

Log into AWS and go into the S3 section then click "Create bucket"

[[file:../images/hugos3/createbucket.png]]

Name the bucket after your website (it doesn't need to be the site name, it can say anything) and select an AWS region, I'm going for eu-west-2 because it's close to me.

[[file:../images/hugos3/namebucket.png]]

Untick the "Block all public access" box and acknowledge the warning at the bottom of that section. See the image above for all the settings I've used. Once you're happy, scroll to the bottom and select "Create bucket"

[[file:../images/hugos3/selectbucket.png]]

Once created, click into the bucket and then click into the properties tab.

[[file:../images/hugos3/selectproperties.png]]

Scroll down to the bottom and select Edit on Static website hosting

[[file:../images/hugos3/selectstatichosting.png]]

Enable static website hosting and enter the page file names index.html and error.html respectively. when you're done save the changes.

[[file:../images/hugos3/editstatichosting.png]]

*  Set up a user in IAM

Open the IAM dashboard and select users from the left-hand side. Select Add Users and add a user called "hugo" with access key as the credential type.

[[file:../images/hugos3/addhugouser.png]]

Go to the next page and select Create Group. Create a group called "hugo", search for s3 in the policies and check the box for AmazonS3FullAccess, then select Create Group. Next click into Tags, add any tags you like, click into Review and when you're happy, create the user.

[[file:../images/hugos3/addhugogroup.png]]

On the final page, you'll be given the Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key

[[file:../images/hugos3/hugoaccesskeys2.png]]


Take a note of these for later and don't share them with anyone:

#+begin_src
Access Key ID:
AKIA4QJB6VGADXAFZ3RZ

Secret Access Key:
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
 #+end_src

* Installing the AWS CLI

Curl the installer file:

#+begin_Src
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"\
unzip awscliv2.zip\
#+end_src

Run the installer:
#+begin_src
sudo ./aws/install
#+end_src
Then configure the CLI with your credentials from earlier

[[file:../images/hugos3/awsconfigure2.png]]

You should now be able to interact with your AWS subscription. Try running "aws s3 ls" and you should see the bucket you've created.

#+begin_src
[username@hostname]$ aws s3 ls
2022-08-19 21:36:22 dougiepeart.co.uk
#+end_src

You've now got the AWS CLI set up, now all that's left is to configure Hugo to push to your bucket (and configure your Hugo site, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial).

* Configuring Hugo

Inside your config.toml file for your Hugo site append the following:

#+begin_src
[deployment]
  [[deployment.targets]]
    name = "aws-s3"
    URL= "s3://dougiepeart.co.uk?region=eu-west-2"

  [[deployment.matchers]]
    # Cache static assets for 1 year.
    pattern = "^.+\\.(js|css|svg|ttf)$"
    cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
    gzip = true

  [[deployment.matchers]]
    pattern = "^.+\\.(png|jpg)$"
    cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
    gzip = false

  [[deployment.matchers]]
    # Set custom content type for /sitemap.xml
    pattern = "^sitemap\\.xml$"
    contentType = "application/xml"
    gzip = true

  [[deployment.matchers]]
    pattern = "^.+\\.(html|xml|json)$"
    gzip = true
#+end_src

Obviously, change the S3 URL to your bucket name and selected region though.

Congratulations you've got everything you need to push your site from your machine to S3!

cd into your websites directory and run:

#+begin_src
~/docs/repos/dougiepeart.co.uk $ hugo && hugo deploy
Start building sites …
hugo v0.101.0+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=unknown

You've now got your site in a publicly accessible S3 bucket :)

You can find the URL in the bucket's properties under the Static website section

But you have to navigate to a stupid URL to see it :(

* Configuring your DNS record.

So, log into Cloudflare (assuming you've set [[https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/][them up as your DNS provider]]) and go into the DNS section.

Ordinarily, you'd set an A record here pointing to an IP address, but as I'm sure you've noticed, AWS didn't allocate us one. Not to worry though, you don't need an A record, you can just use a CNAME.

[[file:../images/hugos3/cname_000.png]]

You can just use @ for the name here, but I've set it as dougiepeart.co.uk for clarity.

Paste in your S3 URL and ensure it is set to proxied as you'll be using this for your SSL certificate.

You should now be able to browse to your website and see your Hugo site :)

* Adding a Certificate

The final step. In Cloudflare, go into the SSL/TLS section on the left-hand side. In the overview, set it to Flexible.

[[file:../images/hugos3/sslflexible.png]]

If you reload your website, you should now have a secure connection.

That's it. You now have super cheap and fast hosting for your static website.
