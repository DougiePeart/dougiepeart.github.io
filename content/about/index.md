I'm Dougie Peart. I work full time as an IT Infrastructure Engineer. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing with different technologies. I'm mostly interested in free and open-source software as it fits with my ideals. We should all strive to help each other improve. Whether that is through the use of free and open-source technology or free and open conversation.

I've started this website to talk about my personal projects and showcase what I've been reading and learning.
