## The Book in 3 Sentences {#the-book-in-3-sentences}

If you were to take over a traditional IT organisation weighed down with decades of technical debt, how could you turn things around? Bill Palmer is the new reluctant VP of IT operations and he needs to figure this out for himself before his company goes under. Bill discovers that the answers are closer than he realises, and by studying the manufacturing process in his own company he can apply an agile methodology to the IT organisation.


## Impressions {#impressions}

I found the book quite eye opening. It really helps to put into context how more effective the previous IT operations I'd worked in could have been if we'd adopted a similar approach to this.


## Who Should Read it? {#who-should-read-it}

Anyone working in the technology field should give this a read. I think it is a great introduction to Agile methodologies and shows how and why to put them in place.


## How the Book Changed Me {#how-the-book-changed-me}

It has made me adopt Kanban as my method of task management. I think it's working out well so far, but time will tell. I may switch to Sprints in the future.


## My Top 3 Quotes {#my-top-3-quotes}


### Page 195 {#page-195}

> Improving daily work is even more important that doing daily work"


### Page 196 {#page-196}

> Studies have shown that practising five minutes daily is better than practising once a week for three hours. And if you want to create a genuine culture of improvement, you create those habits.


### Page 32 {#page-32}

> Situations like this only reinforce my deep suspicion of developers: They're often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving Operations to clean up the mess.

### Tossing blame over the fence {#tossing-blame-over-the-fence}

> Situations like this only reinforce my deep suspicion of developers: They're often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving Operations to clean up the mess.

This is a common view of developers from an IT operations perspective. However, it's quite unfair. I believe the only reason this seems to be the case is because there isn't enough communication between Development and Operations in traditional organisations. With good and frequent communication there would be an ongoing conversation for what changes need to be made and what the impact these changes could have. It's only by not talking that these situations happen and both sides are guilty of it.


### The four type of IT operations work {#the-four-type-of-it-operations-work}


#### Business Projects {#business-projects}

Projects that are important to the outer business (not IT) that need to be performed with help from IT. For example, installing a new payroll system.


#### IT Operations Projects {#it-operations-projects}

Projects that are important to IT. For example, installing a new storage array


#### Changes {#changes}

Small project items that change the operation of an existing system. For example, a version upgrade of an existing database.


#### Unplanned Work {#unplanned-work}

Unforeseen pieces of work that need to be carried out that were not part of an existing project. For example an internet outage.


### Identifying your bottleneck {#identifying-your-bottleneck}

To improve the flow of work you need to identify your constraints. In the book Brent was the main one. He was involved in pretty every piece of operational work at some level. If he was busy with other work some projects would remain at a standstill.

> I close my eyes to think.
> “Work wouldn’t complete on time, because Brent can only be at one
> work center at a time,” I say. Enthusiastically, I continue, “That’s ex-
> actly what’s happening with us. I know that for a bunch of our planned
> changes, work can’t even start if Brent isn’t on hand. When that happens,
> we’ll escalate to Brent, telling him to drop whatever he’s doing, so some
> other work center can get going. We’ll be lucky if he can stay there long
> enough for the change to be completely implemented before he’s inter-
> rupted by someone else.”
