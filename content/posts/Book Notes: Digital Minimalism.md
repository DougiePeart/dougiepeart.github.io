## The Book in 3 Sentences {#the-book-in-3-sentences}

The internet has undoubtedly added incredible value to the world. But have we become so reliant and addicted to using it that it is hindering our productivity?


## Impressions {#impressions}

Newport puts his case across well and provides great ideas on how we can use the internet better to aid us in using the internet to support what we value.


## Who Should Read it? {#who-should-read-it}

Everyone. I think we are all guilty of this to some degree.


## How the Book Changed Me {#how-the-book-changed-me}

I am going to schedule my time more intentionally now to ensure I use the most of it.


## Summary + Notes {#summary-plus-notes}


### Introduction {#introduction}

> In Walden, Thoreau famously writes:
>
> “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.”
>
> Less often quoted, however, is the optimistic rejoinder that follows in his next paragraph:
>
> "They honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices."


### Part 1: Foundations {#part-1-foundations}


#### 1: A Lopsided Arms Race {#1-a-lopsided-arms-race}

> To confirm that this limited vision was not some quirk of Jobs’s keynote script, I spoke with Andy Grignon, who was one of the original iPhone team members. “This was supposed to be an iPod that made phone calls,” he confirmed. “Our core mission was playing music and making phone calls.” As Grignon then explained to me, Steve Jobs was initially dismissive of the idea that the iPhone would become more of a general-purpose mobile computer running a variety of different third-party applications. “The second we allow some knucklehead programmer to write some code that crashes it,” Jobs once told Grignon, “that will be when they want to call 911.”

The iPhone was never supposed to be anything more than a phone and a media player to reduce the number of devices you had to carry around.

> It’s widely accepted that new technologies such as social media and smartphones massively changed how we live in the twenty-first century. There are many ways to portray this change. I think the social critic Laurence Scott does so quite effectively when he describes the modern hyper-connected existence as one in which “a moment can feel strangely flat if it exists solely in itself.”

It's sad, isn't it? You experience something and feel compelled to capture it rather than live in the moment.


#### 2: Digital Minimalism {#2-digital-minimalism}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Principle #1: Clutter is costly.

    > Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Principle #2: Optimization is important.

    > Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Principle #3: Intentionality is satisfying.

    > Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.

    <!--quoteend-->

    > ▪ As he notes in Walden, working a large farm, as many of his Concord neighbors did, required large, stressful mortgages, the need to maintain numerous pieces of equipment, and endless, demanding labor. He describes these farmer neighbors as “crushed and smothered under [their] load” and famously lumps them into the “mass of men lead[ing] lives of quiet desperation.”
    > Thoreau then asks what benefits these worn-down farmers receive from the extra profit they eke out. As he proved in his Walden experiment, this extra work is not enabling the farmers to escape savage conditions: Thoreau was able to satisfy all of his basic needs quite comfortably with the equivalent of one day of work per week. What these farmers are actually gaining from all the life they sacrifice is slightly nicer stuff: venetian blinds, a better quality copper pot, perhaps a fancy wagon for traveling back and forth to town more efficiently.

    We seem to be too obsessed with achieving the most in life and stretching ourselves, but do we need to stretch ourselves that far in every case?


#### 3: Digital Declutter {#3-digital-declutter}

The Digital Declutter is a process that Newport suggests you take at the start of your digital minimalism journey. It involves taking a 30-day break from all optional technologies. Optional technologies are those in which if you stopped using them they would not harm or significantly disrupt your professional or personal life (i.e email)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Step #1: Define Your Technology Rules

    Define your optional technologies: For example, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit or Youtube

<!--list-separator-->

-  Step #2: Take A Thirty-Day Break

<!--list-separator-->

-  Step #3: Reintroduce Technology

    To decide on which technologies to reintroduce Newport offers the following process:

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The Minimalist Technology Screen

        > To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter, it must:
        >
        > 1, Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough).
        >
        > 2, Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better).
        >
        > 3, Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.


### Part 2: Practices {#part-2-practices}

Newport sets out some practices to best achieve Digital Minimalism following your Digital Declutter


#### 4: Spend Time Alone {#4-spend-time-alone}

This doesn't mean becoming a hermit in which you hike miles into the woods and live in a cabin, but instead advocates for spending quality time in solitude so one can free their mind from the outside inputs of other minds to better process your thoughts, feelings and impressions.

Newport suggests that people who are addicted to social media suffer from "Solitude Deprivation":

> To simplify our discussion, let’s give this trend its own name:
> Solitude Deprivation
> A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.


#### 5: Don't click "Like" {#5-don-t-click-like}

Newport contends that remaining in constant social contact with friends and family does not provide quality social interaction. Studies have shown that those that spend more time on social media feel more lonely. Instead, you should ideally focus on having face-to-face interactions with those you care about and unchain yourself from your devices.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: CONSOLIDATE TEXTING

    Newport suggests limiting your texting time to certain portions of the day and treating them more like emails. This allows you to be in control of how text messages fit into your day. Leaving them to when you choose to interact, rather than interrupting you at the whims of others.

    > ▪ When you’re in this mode, text messages become like emails: if you want to see if anyone has sent you something, you must turn on your phone and open the app. You can now schedule specific times for texting—consolidated sessions in which you go through the backlog of texts you received since the last check, sending responses as needed and perhaps even having some brief back-and-forth interaction before apologizing that you have to go, turning the phone back to Do Not Disturb mode, and continuing with your day.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: HOLD CONVERSATION OFFICE HOURS

    Having conversation office hours seems to be a great idea to implement into your life. It allows people to avoid the anxiety of phoning you in case you are busy.

    > ▪ I learned it from a technology executive in Silicon Valley who innovated a novel strategy for supporting high-quality interaction with friends and family: he tells them that he’s always available to talk on the phone at 5:30 p.m. on weekdays. There’s no need to schedule a conversation or let him know when you plan to call—just dial him up. As it turns out, 5:30 is when he begins his traffic-clogged commute home in the Bay Area. He decided at some point that he wanted to put this daily period of car confinement to good use, so he invented the 5:30 rule.

    If someone texts you trying to initiate a low-value conversation over messaging you can instead reply to their text inviting them to call at an allotted time:

    > ▪ I’d love to get up to speed on what’s going on in your life, call me at 5:30 sometime.”


#### 6: Reclaim Leisure {#6-reclaim-leisure}

To truly succeed with Digital Minimalism one replaces their "low-quality leisure" (Social Media) with "high-quality leisure"

<!--list-separator-->

-  The Bennett Principle

    > A decade later, Arnold Bennett took up the cause of active leisure in his short but influential self-help guide, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day. In this book, Bennett notes that the average London middle-class white-collar worker putting in an eight-hour day is left with sixteen additional hours during which he is as free as any gentleman to pursue virtuous activity. Bennett argues that the waking half of these hours could be dedicated to enriching and demanding leisure, but were instead too often wasted by frivolous time-killing pastimes, like smoking, pottering, caressing the piano (but not actually playing), and perhaps deciding to become “acquainted with a genuinely good whiskey.” After an evening of this mindless boredom busting (the Victorian equivalent of idling on your iPad), he notes, you fall exhausted into bed, with all the hours you were granted “gone like magic, unaccountably gone.”
    >
    > Bennett argues that these hours should instead be put to use for demanding and virtuous leisure activities. Bennett, being an early twentieth-century British snob, suggests activities that center on reading difficult literature and rigorous self-reflection. In a representative passage, Bennett dismisses novels because they “never demand any appreciable mental application.” A good leisure pursuit, in Bennett’s calculus, should require more “mental strain” to enjoy (he recommends difficult poetry). He also ignores the possibility that some of this leisure time might be reduced by childcare or housework, as he was writing only for men, who in Bennett’s early twentieth-century middle-class British world, of course, never needed to bother with such things.

    This brings us to our first Leasure lesson.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Leisure Lesson #1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Leisure Lesson #2: Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world.

    > ▪ fully embrace Rogowski’s closing advice: “Leave good evidence of yourself. Do good work.”

    Try to use your leisure time to produce something that you are proud of, this could be a physical object through the craft of woodwork, or a piece of music.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.

    Newport's suggestion here is that you try social activities like board games with friends.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: FIX OR BUILD SOMETHING EVERY WEEK

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: SCHEDULE YOUR LOW-QUALITY LEISURE

    Being a digital minimalist does not mean swearing off social media altogether. You can still do it, but Newport advises that you instead schedule it and limit the amount of time you are exposed to it. Social media can be a very useful tool for knowing what is going on in people's lives, but it must remain that, a tool.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: JOIN SOMETHING

    > ▪ In 1727, Franklin created a social club called the Junto, which he describes as follows in his autobiography:
    > I had form’d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.

    Perhaps we should all take a leaf out of Franklin's book, if we don't have a group of like-minded individuals we can join, why not try creating the group ourselves?

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: FOLLOW LEISURE PLANS

    If your leisure time is filled with low-quality activities you should consider creating and following leisure plans to aid you in creating value in your life.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The Seasonal Leisure Plan

        Every quarter put together a plan that consists of objectives and habits that you intend to honour in the upcoming period.

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  Objective

            Set an objective you would like to achieve and then outline the strategies you will follow to help achieve this objective.

            Here is the example that Newport uses:

            >
            >
            > Objective: Learn on the guitar every song from the A-side of Meet the Beatles!
            >
            > Strategies:
            >
            > Restring and retune my guitar, find the chord charts for the songs, print them, and put them in nice plastic protector sheets.
            >
            > Return to my old habit of regularly practicing my guitar.
            >
            > As incentive, schedule Beatles party in November. Perform songs (get Linda to agree to sing).

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  Habit

            Pick a habit you'd like to keep over the period. These do not have to be related to the objective.

            Here are the examples that Newport gives:

            > Habit: During the week, restrict low-quality leisure to only sixty minutes a night.
            >
            > Habit: Read something in bed every night.
            >
            > Habit: Attend one cultural event per week.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The Weekly Leisure Plan

        At the beginning of each week, set aside time to review your current seasonal leisure plan. Come up with a plan for the week that will help you achieve your objective(s).


#### 7: Join the Attention Resistance {#7-join-the-attention-resistance}

In the final chapter Newport outlines some more practices to help your fight in the war for your attention.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: DELETE SOCIAL MEDIA FROM YOUR PHONE

    If you need to access social media, use your computer instead of your phone.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: TURN YOUR DEVICES INTO SINGLE-PURPOSE COMPUTERS

    When using your device try to limit distractions by utilising distraction-blocking software and/or turning off the wifi to allow yourself to focus on your task.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: USE SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE A PROFESSIONAL

    Follow only what you need on social media to extract only information that adds value.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: EMBRACE SLOW MEDIA

    Rather than following a story as soon as it breaks, instead, wait a day or two to catch up on the story when informed conclusions have been made from those that you trust. In short limit your news sources to a few trusted ones, rather than hundreds of untrusted ones.

<!--list-separator-->

-  PRACTICE: DUMB DOWN YOUR SMARTPHONE

    Consider using swapping to a dumbed down phone such as products like the [Lightphone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) to untether yourself from distractions.


### In Summary {#in-summary}

We all need to think about our use of technology and question whether we are using it as a tool, or whether it has taken over our lives and attention. I know for at least myself in the past I had a very unhealthy relationship with social media and withdrew from it.

First, it was Facebook, and I didn't miss a single thing about the service once I left it. The next was Instagram and I had the same experience, it didn't add any value to my life apart from knowing what those I care about are up to. But is looking at a friend's picture a real interaction with value? I think instead you're better placed to get in touch with them in person or over the phone. Our lives are flooded with low-value interactions these days that mean little.
