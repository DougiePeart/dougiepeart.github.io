This book introduces the tools one needs to deal with life&rsquo;s challenges in a calm and composed manner. You already possess the keys to living a fulfilling and joyous life. Despite having been created centuries ago, its teachings still apply to modern life.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8139ca8">
<p>
I have been applying this in my life for a few weeks now and as overused as this phrase is, it has been life changing for me. I feel like I finally have control and that I can appreciate life for what it is. I am embracing my fate.
</p>

<p>
It is the first book I have taken detailed notes on since school, I think that says a lot about its effect on me.

<h2 id="orgccc3037">My Top 3 Quotes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgccc3037">
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Your mind is yours-and yours alone. If you focus on healthy thoughts and develop balance opinions about your situation, you will cultivate positive emotions and find lasting enthusiasm to live your best life. You will see negativity for what it is: a waste of your energy.&rdquo;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;If you have received an impression of any pleasure, guard yourself and create a delay. Then think of the time you will enjoy the pleasure, and the time after, when you will repent and be disappointed with yourself. On the other side, imagine your happiness if you resist the temptation and get to commend yourself for the victory.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Epictetus, Enchiridion 34

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The only possession the wise person has is virtue, and of this they can never be robbed. Of all else they have merely the use on loan.&rdquo;

<h3 id="org2974097">Myths and Misconceptions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2974097">
<p>
The Stoics often dealt with Stoicism being misunderstood as being a cold philosophy. They were mistaken to be cold and unfeeling. However, Stoics taught that no one should strive to be an unfeeling statue.
</p>

<p>
Living a virtuous life leads to living a life rich with emotion. Embracing the positive, whilst quickly overcoming the negative.
</p>

<p>
Passivity is another common mischaracterisation. Stoics believe you can thrive in any situation, it teaches acceptance of the world as it is. A love of one&rsquo;s fate. Amor Fati. This can be confused with Apathy. &ldquo;Why change,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;if one can be happy even in the worst of life&rsquo;s storms?&rdquo;. It may seem paradoxical, but Stoic acceptance gives one the strength to overcome life&rsquo;s challenges. When a rude person makes aggressive demands, the Stoic accepts that the person in front of them is being hostile, but they can choose how to respond. If the rude person&rsquo;s demands are unjust, the Stoic works for justice.
</p>

<p>
When you direct your attention toward that which you can control, your actions become well-aimed and effective.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc702dbe">
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act it is. If you are going to bathe, place before yourself what happens in the bath: some splashing the water, others pushing against one another, others abusing one another, and some stealing: and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter, if you say to yourself, I now intend to bathe, and to maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature. And so you will do in every act: for thus if any hindrance to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready: it was not this only that I intended, but I intended also to maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.&rdquo;

<h4 id="org45a2c32">Wisdom</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org45a2c32">
<p>
Wisdom is most closely associated with the Discipline of Assent. It can be subdivided into the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good Sense</li>
<li>Good Calculation</li>
<li>Quick-wittedness</li>
<li>Discretion</li>
<li>Resourcefulness</li>
</ul>

<p>
The primary role of Wisdom is to lead you to good; to focus your attention on healthy thoughts, opinions, desires, and aversions. It requires constant attention. Practising wisdom requires you to understand that you aren&rsquo;t required to accept the first reaction that comes to mind. You must instead build a bridge between your reaction and your final action.

<h4 id="orge1019eb">Courage</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge1019eb">
<p>
Courage is mastery over your fears. It stands in opposition to cowardice. Courage is one of the two virtues that are linked to the Discipline of Desire. If you no longer focus your desires and aversions towards the external world but instead strive for virtue, you will unleash the power to act against the intolerable. The Stoics break Courage down into the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Endurance</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>High-mindedness</li>
<li>Cheerfulness</li>
<li>Industriousness</li>

<h4 id="org2760609">Justice</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2760609">
<p>
Justice relates to the Discipline of Action. Justice is not a direct translation of our definition of Justice (to abide by the law). It can be more easily understood as <i>morality</i>. It encompasses all of our interactions with others. Stoicism teaches that all people are valuable and that we are meant to work together. Stoic Justice helps you to work with others, even if they are opposed to it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;He who is running a race ought to endeavour and strive to the utmost of his ability to come off victor; but it is utterly wrong for him to trip up his competitor, or to push him aside. So in life it is not unfair for one to seek for himself what may accrue to his benefit; but it is not right to take it from another.&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
&#x2013;Chrysippus
As quoted in De Officiis by Cicero, iii. 10.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Marcus Aurelius puts it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2:1
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Justice can be broken down into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Goodwill</li>
<li>Benevolence</li>
<li>Kindness</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<h4 id="org41b42a7">Temperance (Moderation)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org41b42a7">

Temperance is control over one&rsquo;s desires and, along with Courage, it is an expected outcome of practising the Discipline of Desire. Moderation stands in opposition to excess. If you desire only virtue, then you can be reasonable in what you want and generous with what you have been given. Moderation can be divided into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Appropriateness</li>
<li>Modesty</li>
<li>Self-control</li>
</ul>

<p>
&ldquo;The Stoics viewed life as a banquet. Picture yourself at a party where the host went all out with the food and drink. Imagine expensive wines, mouthwatering dishes, and decadent desserts. Everyone’s grabbing plates and glasses and heading over to get their fill. How are you going to act? Are you going to pile your plate high so you don’t miss out on anything? Will you fill up your glass knowing there’s not enough of that particular wine for everyone to try? If you miss out on the dessert you had your eye on, will it ruin your night? If you get to it in time, will you take so much that others don’t get to enjoy it? Epictetus says that a Stoic won’t desire that dessert before they have it and therefore won’t be disturbed if they never get it. If the dessert does arrive, they won’t take so much that others will be left without. Also, if they really grasp Stoicism, they might choose to let the dessert pass even though it arrives. That Stoic, Epictetus claims, is worthy of ruling with the gods! The banquet metaphor is meant to apply to all of your interactions. If you direct your desire toward being your best self, you won’t focus on getting things, but on using the things you already have.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Mark off its limits,&rdquo; references a practice called circling the present. It provides a way to relieve stress, catastrophic thinking, and other anxieties. To do this, you only allow yourself to dwell on the present, essentially fencing yourself off from the future and the past. Take a breath. Draw your attention to the present moment. The past is finished. The future is unknowable. Leave anxieties about the future alone; they solely exist in your imagination. You can only act in the present.&ldquo;

This exercise attempts to strip away your personal—and perhaps irrational—feelings concerning your desires. When you think about something you want, it helps to have a clear idea of it. Those expensive sneakers you want? They’re only shoes: leather meant to protect your feet. If you buy them they will wear out, get stained, and eventually become trash. Are shoes really worth stressing over?

Epictetus asked his students to imagine they had a favourite cup. What is it on the most basic level? It’s ceramic. It holds drinks. It’s breakable. He told them to leave behind thoughts of “it’s painted so beautifully” and “it was a birthday present,” so they could see it as just a cup. A cup that, if broken, isn’t worth losing your good flow of life. When anything presents itself to you, particularly if it seems in some way overwhelming, stop and define it at its most basic. Do not add value judgments. Clear away its mystique so that you can move forward with a clear head.

If you are hoping for something to happen, like getting a promotion at work and the anticipation or the outcome turns into negative thoughts.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org4b890f2"></a>Fear<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4b890f2">
<p>
Fear is the expectation of a coming evil. Some of the feelings that flow from fear are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Terror</li>
<li>Hesitation</li>
<li>Shame</li>
<li>Shock</li>
<li>Panic</li>
<li>Anguish (Regret)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shame is the fear of being disgraced, but can you be disgraced if you act with virtue? No, no one can disgrace you and no one can cause you to act without virtue.
</p>

<p>
All fears are built on indifferents. The Dichotomy of Control will help you to see that indifferents are out of your control.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org3cebcca"></a>Lust (Appetite)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3cebcca">
<p>
Lust is the desire for an expected good. It is focused on the future. The future is out of your control so why concern yourself with it?
</p>

<p>
Some of the feelings associated with Lust include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Want</li>
<li>Hatred</li>
<li>Contention</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Lust</li>
<li>Wrath</li>
<li>Rage</li>
</ul>

<p>
Desire only what you have and you will overcome Lust. Imagine living without dissatisfaction? If you can learn to only desire your own virtuous actions in life, then you won&rsquo;t have an overwhelming appetite for indifferent things.

</li>
<li><a id="org0723480"></a>Delight (Pleasure)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org0723480">
<p>
Delight is a mistaken elation over something that seems to be good in the here and now. It includes such things as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rejoicing at others misfortune</li>
<li>Self-gratification</li>
<li>Extravagant joy</li>
</ul>

<p>
This isn&rsquo;t to say that happiness is a bad thing, far from it. Delight ties your well-being to things you own or a particular moment, all of which can be taken from you. The opposite of Delight is Joy, the state of mind that finds positivity despite the impermanence of things or moments.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org671fdb6"></a>Distress<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org671fdb6">
<p>
Distress is the irrational drawing away of the mind from something already present. The following emotions come from Distress:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Malice</li>
<li>Envy</li>
<li>Jealousy</li>
<li>Pity</li>
<li>Grief</li>
<li>Worry</li>
<li>Sorrow</li>
<li>Annoyance</li>
<li>Vexation</li>
<li>Anguish</li>
</ul>

<p>
To overcome Distress, you must make room for other good passions to flourish. One technique for this is the festival mindset:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re alone you should call this tranquillity and freedom, and think of yourself like the gods; and when you are with many, you shouldn&rsquo;t call it a crowd, or trouble, or uneasiness, but festival and company, and contentedly accept it&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Epictetus, Discourses 1:12
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When you are at a festival or a concert, you have a great time and the crowds don&rsquo;t annoy you at all. You welcome the crowds, they are all there with you, and you are all sharing the same experience. These are your people. Why not try applying this to any situation?

</p>

</p>

<p>
End your day with an evening reflection, such as the Pythagorean practice from page 32:
&ldquo;What have I done wrong? What have I done well? What have I left that must be done tomorrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Find the method that works for you. Matthew talks about when he first started he would write a few phrases on scraps of paper and keep them in his pocket. If he felt stressed, he would read a relevant phrase that would help him to centre himself.
</p>

<p>
If you prepare and deal with bad times properly, they&rsquo;ll be good times. That is to say that if you live according to the virtues in every situation and virtues are the only good, then any situation can be a source of contentment for being the best possible version of yourself. This doesn&rsquo;t mean being joyful if someone has died, but rather acting according to what the situation demands of you and being rewarded for that with deep inner satisfaction.
